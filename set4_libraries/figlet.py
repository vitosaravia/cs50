"""
FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 
1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

 _ _ _          _   _     _
| (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
| | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
| | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
|_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/
Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.

FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.

In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:

Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the 
first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the 
name of the font.
Prompts the user for a str of text.
Outputs that text in the desired font.
If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font 
or the second is not the name of a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with 
an error message.
