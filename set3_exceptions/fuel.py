"""
Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. 
For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank 
is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a 
fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then 
outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in 
the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that 
the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead 
to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead 
prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch 
any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
